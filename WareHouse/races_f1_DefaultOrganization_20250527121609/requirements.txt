# requirements.txt
# This file is for specifying Python dependencies required by the project.
# Since the current implementation is front-end (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), 
# there are no direct Python dependencies in this version of the project. 
# However, if a backend or NLP agent were to be implemented in Python,
# the following packages could be considered as potential dependencies:
# transformers==4.30.0  # For natural language processing (e.g., Hugging Face models)
# requests>=2.28.1      # For API calls to image or data services
# flask==2.0.3          # If a Python backend is added for dynamic content generation
# Note: These are hypothetical and not currently used in the provided code.
